          <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold font-serif text-[#7B553C] mb-2">The Three Doshas</h2>
          <p className="text-black  font-serif mb-4">
            According to Ayurveda, each individual is unique, with a distinct constitution known as prakriti, determined by the balance of three fundamental energies or doshas: Vata, Pitta, and Kapha. These doshas govern various physiological functions and influence our physical and mental characteristics. Understanding one's dosha constitution is essential for creating a personalized diet plan that supports optimal health and balance.
          </p>
          <ul className="list-disc list-inside font-serif text-black mb-4">
            <li class="font-serif"><strong class="font-serif">Vata:</strong >  Associated with the elements of air and ether, Vata governs movement and communication in the body. Those with a predominant Vata constitution tend to have dry, light, and cold qualities and may experience digestive issues, anxiety, and irregularity when imbalanced.</li>
            <li class="font-serif"><strong class="font-serif">Pitta:</strong> Representing the elements of fire and water, Pitta governs metabolism, digestion, and transformation. Pitta individuals are typically of medium build with strong digestion and a tendency towards heat-related conditions such as inflammation, acidity, and anger when out of balance.</li>
            <li class="font-serif"><strong class="font-serif">Kapha:</strong> Comprised of the elements of earth and water, Kapha governs structure, stability, and lubrication. Kapha types tend to have a sturdy build, slow metabolism, and may experience weight gain, congestion, and lethargy when imbalanced.</li>
          </ul>
          <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold font-serif text-[#7B553C] mb-2">The Six Tastes</h2>
          <p className="text-black font-serif mb-4">
            In Ayurveda, foods are classified according to their taste (rasa) and their effect on the doshas. There are six tastes: sweet, sour, salty, bitter, pungent, and astringent. Including a balance of all six tastes in each meal is believed to promote satiety, proper digestion, and overall health.
          </p>
          <ul className="list-disc list-inside font-serif text-black mb-4">
            <li class="font-serif"><strong class="font-serif">Sweet (Madhura):</strong> Nourishing and grounding, sweet foods include grains, dairy, fruits, and root vegetables. They pacify Vata and Pitta but may aggravate Kapha in excess.</li>
            <li class="font-serif"><strong class="font-serif">Sour (Amla):</strong> Stimulating and warming, sour foods include citrus fruits, yogurt, vinegar, and fermented foods. They pacify Vata but may aggravate Pitta and Kapha in excess.</li>
            <li class="font-serif"><strong class="font-serif">Salty (Lavana):</strong> Hydrating and strengthening, salty foods include sea salt, seaweed, and salty snacks. They pacify Vata and increase Pitta and Kapha when consumed excessively.</li>
            <li class="font-serif"><strong class="font-serif">Bitter (Tikta):</strong> Detoxifying and cooling, bitter foods include leafy greens, turmeric, bitter melon, and fenugreek. They pacify Pitta and Kapha but may aggravate Vata in excess.</li>
            <li class="font-serif"><strong class="font-serif">Pungent (Katu):</strong> Stimulating and heating, pungent foods include chili peppers, garlic, ginger, and mustard seeds. They pacify Kapha and increase Vata and Pitta when consumed excessively.</li>
            <li class="font-serif"><strong class="font-serif">Astringent (Kashaya):</strong> Drying and cooling, astringent foods include legumes, green tea, cranberries, and pomegranate. They pacify Pitta and Kapha but may aggravate Vata in excess.</li>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold font-serif text-[#7B553C] mb-2">Principles of Ayurvedic Nutrition</h2>
          <p className="text-black font-serif mb-4">
            In Ayurveda, food is considered not only for its nutritional value but also for its energetic properties, tastes, and effects on the doshas. Here are some key principles of Ayurvedic nutrition:
          </p>
          <ul className="list-disc list-inside font-serif text-black mb-4">
            <li class="font-serif"><strong class="font-serif">Eat According to Your Dosha:</strong> Individuals with different dosha constitutions have unique dietary needs and should tailor their diet accordingly. For example, Vata types may benefit from warm, nourishing foods that calm their sensitive digestion, while Pitta types may thrive on cooling, hydrating foods that soothe inflammation.</li>
            <li class="font-serif"><strong class="font-serif">Emphasize Fresh, Seasonal Foods:</strong> Ayurveda emphasizes the importance of eating fresh, seasonal foods that are locally grown and in harmony with nature's cycles. Eating seasonally ensures that you receive the nutrients your body needs to adapt to environmental changes and maintain balance.</li>
            <li class="font-serif"><strong class="font-serif">Mindful Eating:</strong> Ayurveda teaches the importance of mindful eating, which involves paying attention to the tastes, textures, and sensations of food as you eat. Eating in a calm, relaxed environment, free from distractions, allows for better digestion and absorption of nutrients.</li>
            <li class="font-serif"><strong class="font-serif">Balanced Meals:</strong> Each meal should include a balance of all six tastes—sweet, sour, salty, bitter, pungent, and astringent—to satisfy the palate and support proper digestion. Including a variety of colors, textures, and flavors on your plate ensures that you receive a wide range of nutrients and phytochemicals.</li>
            <li class="font-serif"><strong class="font-serif">Cooking Methods:</strong> Ayurveda recommends cooking methods that enhance the digestibility and bioavailability of nutrients, such as steaming, boiling, sautéing, and stewing. Avoiding overly processed, fried, or microwaved foods helps preserve the natural vitality and prana (life force) of the ingredients.</li>
          </ul>
          <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold font-serif text-[#7B553C] mb-2">Conclusion</h2>
          <p className="text-black font-serif">
            Incorporating Ayurvedic principles of diet and nutrition into your daily life can promote balance, vitality, and longevity. By understanding your dosha constitution, choosing nourishing foods that support your unique needs, and practicing mindful eating, you can cultivate optimal health and well-being from the inside out.
